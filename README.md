# Face_Mask_Detection
Simple Face Mask Detection using YOLO v3 and Google Colab.

You only look once, or YOLO, is one of the faster object detection algorithms out there. 
Though it is no longer the most accurate object detection algorithm, 
it is a very good choice when you need an easy implementation, without loss of too much accuracy.

Prepare a Folder containing all the Images and its annotations in a folder, simillar to the Example Image.

This method works for both Images and Videos.

Make sure to Mount your Google Drive as it will make things easier for you, if you are using Colab.

You can train with your own dataset or use my weights which is provided. Remember, the weights provided works better with simpler images. 
You can also retrain using my weights.
